API Integration 
const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${randomId}`);
- Pulls Pokémon ID, name, sprites and types to display and store for filtering in the Pokédex

1. Analyze Date Stored in Arrays / Objects

currentPokemon = {
  id,
  name,
  sprite,
  shiny,
  types
};

pokedex.filter(p => p.types.includes(currentTypeFilter));

Data is stored locally and filtered through, counted and displayed. 

2. Create a function with 2+ parameters

function pickSprite(pokemon, isShiny)

Used to choose whether to use a shiny or regular Sprite for the Pokémon display.

3. Calculate & display data based on an external factor

const now = new Date();

document.getElementById('date').textContent = dateString;
document.getElementById('time').textContent = timeString;

4. Persist data to local storage

localStorage.setItem("pokedex", JSON.stringify(pokedex));

localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(arr));

Stores the items on the to do list and Pokémon to the Pokédex for future reference.
