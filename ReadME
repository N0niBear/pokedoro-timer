CodeYou Capstone Requirements

API Integration 
const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${randomId}`);
- Pulls Pokémon ID, name, sprites and types to display and store for filtering in the Pokédex

1. Analyze Date Stored in Arrays / Objects

currentPokemon = {
  id,
  name,
  sprite,
  shiny,
  types
};

pokedex.filter(p => p.types.includes(currentTypeFilter));

Data is stored locally and filtered through, counted and displayed. 

2. Create a function with 2+ parameters

function pickSprite(pokemon, isShiny)

Used to choose whether to use a shiny or regular Sprite for the Pokémon display.

3. Calculate & display data based on an external factor

const now = new Date();

document.getElementById('date').textContent = dateString;
document.getElementById('time').textContent = timeString;

4. Persist data to local storage

localStorage.setItem("pokedex", JSON.stringify(pokedex));

localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(arr));

Stores the items on the to do list and Pokémon to the Pokédex for future reference.


Future Enhancements 
- User settings for custom timer durations
- Sound effects and animations
- Dark mode toggle
- Timers continue while navigating other pages
- More readible fontface
- Note page to take notes
- Catch a Pokémon when a task is checked off the To Do List

Known Issues & Limitations
- To-do list input is only validated for empty values
- Study and break timers use predefined durations and cannot currently be customized by the user
- All user data is stored in the browser using `localStorage`
- The application assumes a single user and does not support accounts, login functionality, or shared data across devices
- Break timer does not start until catch or release of Pokémon
- Pause/Resume button actively works no matter the state
